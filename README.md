# password_generator-project

This website can generate a random, secure password that is not linked to any of your other passwords. It can also check the security level of a password.

You just need to enter the password requirements, i.e., password length, whether to include numbers, etc. and the password will get generated. To generate a new password with the same criteria, just reload the page. 

Then you can check security of a password and have it rated by entering it onto the test security page.

This website is also live on the internet! You can see it at https://shonsave.pythonanywhere.com/

NOTE: Your passwords will not be stored anywhere, this site is completely safe and reliable. And you better write the password down somewhere, you might forget it.
